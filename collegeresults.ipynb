Our school grades out of 100 to be quirky idk\\n* Rank (or percentile): school doesn\\'t officially rank, but I am top 1-2% out of \\\\~350 students\\n* Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 9 APs by graduation (Chinese, World History, Computer Science A, US History, Chemistry, Calc BC already taken). 6 DE courses (Syracuse University & local community college). 12 Honors courses\\n* Senior year coarse load: AP French, AP Lit, AP Physics C, DE Economics, DE Public policy, Symphony orchestra, Multivariable calculus (online course, school doesn\\'t offer math past calc bc)\\n\\n**Standardized Testing**\\n\\n* SAT: 1540 (740 EBRW, 800M)\\n* APs: All 5s except a 4 on APUSH. That class was the death of me but its all good\\n\\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\\n\\n1. **Science Olympiad:** Captain (12), Treasurer (11-12), Secretary (10). Varsity member for all 4 years of high school. Competed at invitationals, regionals, and states. Regionals champion for like 20 something years. placed top 10 in states my sophomore year. We used to be a real powerhouse team in New York, but COVID hit us super hard and  we\\'re still in the recovery process.  In the common app I mentioned 25 medals over 4 years, how I managed the club treasury for any invitationals we go to and any materials we buy for events, and how I act as a proctor and test writer for the invitational that our high school hosts.\\n2. **Research Intern:** Conducted research at local medical university to find climate change\\'s effects on fly feeding patterns. Not published or anything crazy like that, just thought it was a good way to gain lab experience. Prof pretty much taught me the protocol and let me go crazy after\\n3. **Cello:** did school chamber for 3 years, also member of regions top orchestra for 2 years (not school affiliated). Never did all state or anything like that (not good enough lmao).\\n4. **Science Honors Society**: President (12) meh, exactly what it sounds like. we organize volunteer opportunities for stuff like science experiments at library, volunteer at a farm to donate to local food pantry, etc. i honestly don\\'t know why i put this up so high \\n5. **School Newspaper:** Managing Editor (10-12). Went to local journalism conferences, edited and wrote articles, in charge of print layout \\n6. **Suicide Awareness Club:** Treasurer (12). Managed funds for all events, helped organize events with AFSP and local mental health resources. \\n7. **Spikeball Club:** Cofounder, what can I say I\\'m just good at smacking balls. Made this club with friends. I once broke my wrist while diving for a spike, so you know I\\'m dedicated 💪💪\\n8. **AAPI Cultural Heritage club:** K-pop dancer for our annual AAPI heritage assembly. Love dancing, doesn\\'t mean I\\'m good at it lol\\n9. **Model United Nations:** just a delegate, didn\\'t really do much. I find the socializing more fun than committee debate \\n10. **Lifting:** lol, I was contemplating whether or not to include this but it\\'s taken a significant amount of my time in HS and I actually enjoy it so I was like why not. yummy dopamine \\n\\n**Awards/honors:** \\n\\n1. Science Olympiad big invitational medal \\n2. Science Olympiad states medal \\n3. Science Olympiad states medal \\n4. National Merit Semifinalist (barely on the cutoff)\\n5. AP Scholar with distinction \\n\\n**Letters of Recommendation** keep in mind these ratings might be completely inaccurate since I never read the letters\\n\\n* **AP Chemistry Teacher:** (7/10). My chem teacher in 11th grade. No clue what she wrote about me, but I was a good student in her class and often stopped by when I needed help with chemistry for Science Olympiad. \\n* **AP Physics Teacher:** (10/10). My physics teacher this year (12th grade), but also my Science Olympiad coach. Was with me throughout all of high school, seen me at my lowest lows and highest highs (and the lows were pretty low). He was really the only one to see my entire development right from the beginning of high school. He told me he started crying while writing my letter, so I\\'m sure it was beautiful\\n* **Counselor :** (6/10). Same thing with the chem teacher, I wasn\\'t super close with him but he knew I was high achieving. Probably closer to him than my peers were, since I had meetings with him to discuss summer plans (basically let him know what I was doing lol). He wrote me an email earlier to congratulate me which was really nice \\n\\n**Interviews**\\n\\n* **UPenn Interview:** I think it went really good. It lasted about an hour, and the interviewer basically asked me two questions: Why Penn, and what do you do outside of school. It was honestly super chill. He talked about his experience with Penn and answered all my questions, and at the end he said he thought I was a great fit!\\n\\n**Essays**\\n\\n* Common App: wrote about growth and change of perspective on life after death of friends. won\\'t go into it more because its personal, but I did a lot of introspection during the writing process, I think it is something that I can be proud of.  My AO sent me an email later that said she thought my personal statement was very moving, so I think this essay was a major reason as to why I got in  \\n* Penn supplementals: I am proud of them, but they are probably very standard essays. I pretty much told them straight up what my life at penn would look like if I was admitted. I tried to create a narrative with each one, but overall didn\\'t do anything \"quirky\" with them. \\n   * Gratitude Letter: I wrote the letter to my late friend set in a time where they were still here (the admissions officers didn\\'t know this, so it would just seem like a letter to a friend without the hidden meaning behind it). I often journal with prompts similar to this, so the writing process was familiar to me. \\n   * Why community: I talked about existing clubs at penn, why I wanted to join them and how I would contribute to the community through them. These clubs were related to my cello playing, and science olympiad participation. \\n   * Why engineering: talked about my research and how penngineering facilities would grant me more opportunity to expand my previous work and go into other fields\\n* nothing else because I am a procrastinating slacker hehe \\n\\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD**\\n\\n* Binghamton (EA): >!Accepted!<\\n* UPenn (ED): >!Accepted! Go quakers 🧑🏻\\u200d🦳🧑🏻\\u200d🦳🧑🏻\\u200d🦳👨🏻\\u200d🦳👨🏻\\u200d🦳👨🏻\\u200d🦳👨🏻\\u200d🦳!!<\\n* >!withdrew GTech, Boston University, Stony Brook University !<\\n\\n**Reflection:**\\n\\n* In the same letter where the AO commented on my personal statement, they also mentioned my work in the suicide awareness/prevention club as something noteworthy\\n* I think my application was very well rounded. It didn\\'t have anything on the international level, or even much on the national level, so I\\'d like to believe my academics and essays pulled their weight\\n* Use the college application process to find more about yourself! Especially with your personal statement. If you don\\'t walk away with an acceptance you wanted, you at least will have walked away with a more complete view of yourself \\n* i binged this subreddit over the summer, soooooo i hope you guys enjoy my contribution to the content ocean \\n\\nyou guys all got this! feel free to ask any questions '"
