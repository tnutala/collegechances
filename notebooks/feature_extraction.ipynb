      "Up until junior year, I had absolutely no clue about anything concerning or relating to college. I had no idea which colleges were the Ivies or anything like the T20s (many of which I'd never heard of), what I needed to do for the applications, and even my major. I chose my major when I had to write about it for supplementals, since I just couldn't pick before then. As I trudged through college app season, I learned most of what I know now from YouTube videos, some subreddits, and the people around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some general tips**:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Start early! Essays take time to write. I started brainstorming my Common App essay in late July, scrapped my idea in early August, and only finished it in late October (right before EAs lmao). I had a friend who was chilling since he finished all of his in September. Be that friend. During senior year fall, you're stacked with homework, college apps, and probably even more. I kept finishing applications barely before the deadline, which took quite a toll on my mentality and my academics.\n",
      "* Do research on the colleges! I knew almost nothing about all the colleges I applied to. Many of the colleges on my list were picked based on my parents' opinions and friends I knew who went to a certain college, since I just didn't know where to apply. I'd say it's good to research your plans for both academic and extracurricular experiences in (insert college), so you can mention them in your essays and you have some plans for life beyond academics if you get in.\n",
      "* I think essays are the most convincing way for you to get into any school, as I'm almost sure my essays were the driving factor behind my acceptance. Since I never considered academic achievements beyond getting good grades, I didn't have any competitions, awards, research, internships, etc to show for, so I tried my best to focus on writing essays that could demonstrate my character in compelling and intriguing ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Essay info**:\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that at the end of the day, the goal of the application is to market yourself to the AOs! I found that the best way for me to do that was to do narrative essays where I could communicate my emotions most interestingly and creatively. For brainstorming, I listed several topics I could write about and started to write each one as if it were my final essay. After that, I could narrow down what topics and essays felt 'right' to me, and which ones could display my character the most accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may be personal preference, but I like being more dynamic, dramatic, or even cliche in the essays. Emotive and expressive writing is great for connecting with the AOs, and I think it’s a great way to market yourself as a vivid, appealing, and memorable person, which will definitely make you pop as a person more than just your stats (the AOs will no doubt have seen many, many impressive ones, so the essays are extremely important and compelling in advertising yourself to them). However, it’s still important to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hammer in how essential your chosen essay topic is to your character and growth as a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, make the AOs want YOU on their campus!!! Don’t just say what you find interesting about and would gain from (insert college), persuade them that you’ll be an excellent contribution to their community! It’s all about mutual exchanges and give and take; convince them that you’ll leave the campus a better place in your own unique way (for supplementals, be specific as you can about how you’d imagine doing so!)\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot even begin to explain how much I relate to this terrible, tedious process of learning, brainstorming, editing, scrapping ideas, and starting over with college apps. Although I can't guarantee I'll be able to answer everything, if you have any questions, I’d be happy to help!\n",

Wish I had done more (they're for sure the weakest part of my application), but I'm glad I made a point not to cynically do application fluff like honors societies and whatnot.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAwards/Honors\\n\\n\\\\#1   NATIONAL MERIT SEMIFINALIST - Big one, NJ is the hardest state to get it in I'm so lucky I barely made the cutoff.\\n\\n\\\\#2   Local Scholarship for 5's on STEM APs\\n\\n\\\\#3   AP Scholar something\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLetters of Recommendation\\n\\nLetter from US History Teacher - idk 6/10\\n\\nLetter from Bio Teacher - we were closer, I'd guess 8/10\\n\\nHave no way of knowing, ofc\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEssays\\n\\nMy common app essay was about my learning to love nature and how that ties in with my love of discovery and curiosity (heavily feature a carpenter bee).  Honestly was a pretty solid, original essay that is IMO well written and entertaining.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\\n\\nAcceptances:\\n\\nNJIT EA1 (Honors College) - COMMITTED!\\n\\nSome super random safeties no one cares about (Sorry UMaine)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAdditional Info:\\n\\nMy only goal with college apps was to get as much money as I possibly could.  I have no financial support whatsoever (barring 5500 in fasfa loans), and thanks to my parents being conservative Christians and me being trans, I won't have a home to go back to during breaks.  While me having national merit should've been a ticket to a plethora of full rides, every single one was located in a state that has been actively pushing anti trans laws (Texas, Florida, Alabama, etc.) that I simply would not feel safe to live in.  After looking around, I figured that my best shot at getting the money I needed was NJIT, through the Albert Dorman Honors College.  If I didn't get in, at least the university offers full tuition for NMFs anyway (if I would be able to manage finding a room nearby and all my costs).  Therefore, I didn't see the point in any regular decision, since any top private aid wouldn't beat full tution, and the application fees come out of my own pocket.  I really tailored my application and supplemental essay towards NJIT, and also wrote a mini essay in additional info explaining my whole situation.\\n\\nThank god this Hail Mary worked.  I know my application was good, but honors is crazy competitive (1500+ sat average, only 150 slots a year) and it's a crazy relief I got in.  Being constantly worried that you won't be able to attend a college right after high school and that you might have to move by yourself out of state or something drastic to afford to live really makes you appreciate the opportunity of a full ride.  I'm super excited for college and can't wait to be a student full time!\""
